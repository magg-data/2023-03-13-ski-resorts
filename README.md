# About

The purpose of this study is to build a dashboard to help skiers find their ideal destination for the next winter season. The dashboard should allow for exploration and interactivity.


The original dataset includes details on 499 ski resorts around the world (location, slopes, lifts, prices, and ski season). There is also a table with the snow cover around the world for each month of 2022 by latitude and longitude. It contains two data tables in CSV format and description of fields.

The dashboard was implemented in R Shiny.
